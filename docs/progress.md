### Completed VIBECONTROL self-documentation

**Context:** After bootstrapping VIBECONTROL for self-maintenance, need to populate documentation following protocol guidelines. This demonstrates dogfooding and validates protocol effectiveness.

**Changes:**
- Updated docs/progress.md with detailed historical entries
  - Documented all work from initial commit through bootstrap
  - Added timestamps and complete context for each milestone
  - Followed VIBECONTROL format: Context, Changes, Outcome, Issues, Next
- Created docs/plans/meta-vibecontrol-development.md
  - Comprehensive roadmap for protocol evolution
  - Task breakdown: protocol, tooling, documentation, community, ecosystem
  - 40+ tasks across core development areas
  - Defined technical approach and risk mitigations
- Created docs/knowledge/protocol-design-principles.md
  - Documented six core principles: Files Over Abstractions, LLM-First Design, Git-Native, Progressive Disclosure, Tool-Agnostic, Zero Dependencies
  - Explained rationale, implementation, trade-offs for each principle
  - Addressed design tensions and resolutions
  - Defined anti-patterns and future evolution guidelines
- Created docs/knowledge/meta-repository-architecture.md
  - Explained meta-repository concept (defines protocol vs. implements it)
  - Documented two audiences: human developers and LLM assistants
  - Clarified repository structure and file relationships
  - Addressed common confusion points
  - Established development implications and evolution path

**Outcome:**
- VIBECONTROL project fully documents itself using VIBECONTROL protocol
- Complete project history preserved in progress.md
- Development roadmap established in plans/
- Design rationale and architecture captured in knowledge/
- Demonstrates protocol effectiveness through real usage
- Future LLM sessions can understand project context immediately

**Issues:** None

**Next:**
- Test install.sh across different environments (macOS, Linux, Windows Git Bash)
- Create install.js for Node.js/npx users
- Create install.py for Python/uv users
- Begin creating example projects demonstrating VIBECONTROL usage
- Set up community channels (GitHub Discussions, Discord)

**Related:**
- docs/plans/meta-vibecontrol-development.md - ongoing protocol work
- docs/knowledge/protocol-design-principles.md - design rationale
- docs/knowledge/meta-repository-architecture.md - project structure

### Bootstrapped VIBECONTROL for self-maintenance

**Context:** VIBECONTROL project itself should use VIBECONTROL for its own maintenance. This provides dogfooding, ensures protocol works as designed, and demonstrates best practices.

**Changes:**
- Ran `./install.sh --standard` to create docs/ structure
- Created docs/VIBECONTROL.md (protocol specification)
- Created docs/progress.md (this file)
- Created docs/plans/ directory for task management
- Created docs/knowledge/ directory for stable reference material
- Generated READMEs for plans/ and knowledge/ directories

**Outcome:**
- VIBECONTROL project now uses VIBECONTROL protocol
- Meta-repository structure established
- Ready to document protocol development using the protocol itself

**Issues:** None

**Next:**
- Create docs/plans/meta-vibecontrol-development.md for ongoing protocol maintenance
- Document protocol design principles in docs/knowledge/
- Update progress.md as work continues

### Created installation script

**Context:** Users need easy way to set up VIBECONTROL in their projects. Manual directory creation is error-prone and tedious.

**Changes:**
- Created install.sh bash script with interactive setup
- Implemented four setup modes: minimal, standard, full, custom
- Added automatic VIBECONTROL.md copying
- Added README.md and CLAUDE.md update prompts
- Included gitignore suggestions for proc/ directory
- Added colored output and helpful next-steps guidance

**Outcome:**
- One-command installation: `./install.sh --standard`
- Users can choose setup complexity appropriate for project
- Script handles edge cases (existing files, missing files)
- Clear feedback and next steps provided

**Issues:**
- Script assumes bash environment (macOS/Linux)
- Need to create npm/Python equivalents for broader compatibility

**Next:**
- Test installation script across different environments
- Create install.js for Node.js users
- Create install.py for Python users

**Related:** README.md installation section

### Added CLAUDE.md with project guidance

**Context:** Claude Code reads CLAUDE.md files to understand project-specific guidance. Since VIBECONTROL is a meta-repository (defines a protocol rather than implements it), Claude needs clear guidance about this distinction.

**Changes:**
- Created CLAUDE.md file at repository root
- Documented repository architecture (meta-repository concept)
- Explained two audiences: human developers and LLM assistants
- Clarified relationship between README.md and VIBECONTROL.md
- Added guidance for making protocol changes
- Documented key design principles
- Noted important distinctions about what this repository is/isn't

**Outcome:**
- Claude Code now understands project structure and purpose
- Clear guidelines for maintaining protocol coherence
- Documented division of concerns between README and VIBECONTROL.md
- Established principles for future development

**Issues:** None

**Next:** Continue protocol refinement based on real-world usage

**Related:** README.md, VIBECONTROL.md

### Created comprehensive README

**Context:** Need user-facing documentation explaining what VIBECONTROL is, why it exists, and how to use it. Target audience is developers considering adopting the protocol.

**Changes:**
- Created README.md with complete project overview
- Documented the problem: session amnesia, context loss, tool-switching chaos
- Explained the solution: file-based context management protocol
- Added feature highlights with real-world benefits
- Created usage examples for common scenarios
- Added philosophy section explaining design principles
- Included comparison to alternatives
- Added contribution guidelines, support info, and FAQ

**Outcome:**
- Clear value proposition for VIBECONTROL
- Step-by-step getting started guide
- Multiple use case examples (solo dev, team, enterprise)
- Philosophy and principles clearly articulated

**Issues:** None

**Next:** Create actual installation scripts referenced in README
- install.sh for bash/Unix
- install.js for Node.js/npx
- install.py for Python/uv

**Related:** VIBECONTROL.md (the protocol specification itself)

### Initial repository setup

**Context:** Starting new project to define VIBECONTROL protocol. Need version control and basic structure.

**Changes:**
- Initialized git repository
- Created initial commit
- Set up repository structure

**Outcome:**
- Repository ready for protocol development
- Version control established

**Next:** Define protocol specification and user documentation
