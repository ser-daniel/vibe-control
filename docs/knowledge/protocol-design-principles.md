# VIBECONTROL Protocol Design Principles

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-06
**Stability:** Stable

## Summary

VIBECONTROL is designed around six core principles that prioritize simplicity, clarity, and practical utility for LLM-assisted development. These principles guide all protocol decisions and help maintain focus on solving real problems without unnecessary complexity.

## Core Principles

### 1. Files Over Abstractions

**Principle:** Everything is a markdown file in your git repository. No databases, no APIs, no custom formats.

**Rationale:**
- Files are universal - every developer understands them
- Git provides versioning, branching, merging for free
- No tool lock-in - any text editor, any IDE works
- Human-readable and machine-parsable simultaneously
- Zero runtime dependencies or infrastructure

**Implementation:**
```
docs/
├── VIBECONTROL.md          # Protocol instructions
├── progress.md             # Chronological work log
├── plans/                  # Task breakdowns (one file per feature)
├── knowledge/              # Stable reference material
├── schema/                 # Architecture diagrams (.mmd files)
└── proc/                   # Process logs and snapshots
```

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Simple, transparent, durable
- ✅ Works offline, no external dependencies
- ❌ No real-time querying (but files are fast)
- ❌ No built-in search (but git grep works fine)

**Alternatives Considered:**
- SQLite database → Rejected: not human-readable, requires tooling
- JSON/YAML → Rejected: harder for humans to read/write
- Custom binary format → Rejected: vendor lock-in, complexity

### 2. LLM-First Design

**Principle:** The protocol is optimized for LLM comprehension and execution, not just human reading.

**Rationale:**
- LLMs are the primary consumers of this context
- Structure must be deterministic and parseable
- Instructions must be explicit, not implicit
- Format should minimize ambiguity
- AI assistants should understand what to do without lengthy prompting

**Implementation:**
- Clear, structured formats with explicit headings
- Timestamped entries (ISO 8601: YYYY-MM-DD)
- Consistent templates across all documentation types
- Explicit "when to update" instructions in VIBECONTROL.md
- Operational procedures defined step-by-step

**Example - Progress Entry Format:**
```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC

### [Brief descriptive title]
**Context:** Why this work was needed
**Changes:** What was actually done
**Outcome:** What works now
**Issues:** Problems encountered
**Next:** Logical next steps
```

**Why This Works:**
- LLMs can parse structured format reliably
- Clear semantic sections (Context, Changes, Outcome, etc.)
- Timestamp provides temporal ordering
- Consistent format across all entries

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ LLMs maintain documentation accurately
- ✅ Reduced prompt engineering needed
- ❌ Slightly more verbose than free-form
- ✅ But verbosity ensures completeness

### 3. Git-Native

**Principle:** Leverage version control semantics developers already understand. Don't reinvent infrastructure.

**Rationale:**
- Developers already use git daily
- Version control provides time-travel through context
- Branching/merging solves multi-developer coordination
- Commit history shows evolution of decisions
- No new mental models to learn

**Implementation:**
- All context lives in git repository alongside code
- docs/ directory committed to version control
- Changes to context tracked like code changes
- Branches can have different context states
- Merge conflicts in docs/ resolved manually (rare)

**Git Workflows with VIBECONTROL:**
```bash
# Branch for experimental feature
git checkout -b feature/experiment

# docs/plans/feature-experiment.md created and tracked

# Context evolves on branch
git commit -m "Document experiment approach"

# Merge brings context back to main
git merge feature/experiment

# History shows decision evolution
git log docs/progress.md
```

**Benefits:**
- Audit trail of all decisions
- Revert bad documentation like bad code
- See who added what knowledge when
- Context synchronized with code state

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Leverages existing infrastructure
- ✅ Familiar mental model for developers
- ❌ Requires git knowledge (but developers already have it)
- ✅ Works offline by default

### 4. Progressive Disclosure

**Principle:** Start simple, add complexity only when needed. Don't force complexity on simple projects.

**Rationale:**
- Not all projects need all features
- Solo developers have different needs than teams
- Simple projects don't need schema diagrams or process logs
- Protocol should scale from minimal to comprehensive

**Implementation - Four Setup Levels:**

**Minimal:** Just `progress.md`
- For: Solo developer, simple projects
- Provides: Basic session continuity
- When: Getting started, small scripts

**Standard:** `progress.md` + `plans/` + `knowledge/`
- For: Most projects, small teams
- Provides: Task management + pattern documentation
- When: Multi-feature projects, reusable patterns emerge

**Full:** All modules including `schema/` + `proc/`
- For: Complex projects, larger teams
- Provides: Architecture diagrams + detailed debugging logs
- When: Complex systems, architectural decisions important

**Custom:** Pick exactly what you need
- For: Projects with specific needs
- Provides: Flexibility to adapt protocol
- When: You know your requirements

**Adoption Path:**
```
Start with minimal → Outgrow it → Add plans/ + knowledge/
→ Need diagrams? → Add schema/ → Need detailed debugging? → Add proc/
```

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Low barrier to entry
- ✅ Grows with project complexity
- ❌ Users might not know what they need initially (but can add later)
- ✅ Modularity prevents bloat

### 5. Tool-Agnostic

**Principle:** Work with any LLM, any IDE, any workflow. No vendor lock-in.

**Rationale:**
- AI tool landscape is evolving rapidly
- Developers use different tools for different tasks
- Context should persist across tool switches
- Avoid dependency on any single platform

**Implementation:**
- Protocol defined as text file (VIBECONTROL.md)
- No custom APIs or SDKs required
- Works with Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, Copilot, local models
- Standard markdown format universally supported
- No cloud services or external dependencies

**Cross-Tool Usage:**
```
Monday: Use Claude via claude.ai → Updates docs/progress.md
Tuesday: Use Cursor in IDE → Reads progress.md, continues work
Wednesday: Use ChatGPT → Loads same context, different LLM
Thursday: Use local Llama → Still works, context intact
```

**Integration Methods:**
- **Claude Code:** Reads CLAUDE.md and VIBECONTROL.md automatically
- **Cursor:** Add to .cursorrules
- **ChatGPT:** Paste VIBECONTROL.md in conversation
- **Copilot:** Reference in README.md
- **MCP Servers:** Can expose VIBECONTROL context via MCP protocol
- **Local Models:** Just read the files like any other LLM

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Future-proof against tool evolution
- ✅ Freedom to use best tool for each task
- ❌ No tool-specific optimizations (but simplicity is the optimization)
- ✅ Reduced lock-in risk

### 6. Zero Dependencies

**Principle:** No frameworks, platforms, or external services. Just markdown files.

**Rationale:**
- Dependencies create maintenance burden
- External services can disappear or change pricing
- Frameworks add complexity and learning curve
- Simple solutions are more durable

**What VIBECONTROL Doesn't Require:**
- ❌ No npm packages
- ❌ No Python libraries
- ❌ No cloud services
- ❌ No APIs to call
- ❌ No databases to maintain
- ❌ No authentication/authorization
- ❌ No configuration files (beyond the docs themselves)

**What You Already Have:**
- ✅ Text editor
- ✅ Git
- ✅ Markdown rendering (optional, for viewing)
- ✅ LLM access (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)

**Total Installation:**
```bash
mkdir -p docs/plans docs/knowledge
touch docs/progress.md
cp VIBECONTROL.md docs/
# Done. That's it.
```

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Never breaks due to dependency updates
- ✅ Works 10 years from now unchanged
- ✅ No supply chain security concerns
- ❌ No fancy UI (but simplicity is feature)
- ❌ No automated analytics (but git provides insights)

## Design Tensions and Resolutions

### Tension: Flexibility vs. Consistency

**Tension:** Allow customization vs. maintain standardization

**Resolution:** 
- Core format is standardized (progress.md structure)
- Extensions and additions are encouraged
- Users can add fields, sections, directories
- As long as LLM can understand it, it's valid VIBECONTROL

### Tension: Human-Readable vs. Machine-Parseable

**Tension:** Optimize for human reading vs. LLM parsing

**Resolution:**
- Markdown provides both
- Structured headings give machines clear anchors
- Prose provides humans with context and nuance
- Templates balance structure with flexibility

### Tension: Completeness vs. Conciseness

**Tension:** Document everything vs. avoid bloat

**Resolution:**
- "Context over volume" - quality over quantity
- Archive old entries after 30-90 days
- Mark knowledge as deprecated rather than deleting
- Focus on decision rationale, not implementation details

### Tension: Standardization vs. Tool-Agnosticism

**Tension:** Provide tool integrations vs. remain independent

**Resolution:**
- Core protocol is tool-agnostic
- Optional integrations provided (MCP, Cursor, etc.)
- Integrations are additions, not requirements
- Base functionality works without any tooling

## Anti-Patterns and What We Avoid

**❌ Don't:** Create custom file format requiring special parser
**✓ Do:** Use standard markdown universally supported

**❌ Don't:** Build SaaS platform with accounts and pricing
**✓ Do:** Remain protocol only, no platform required

**❌ Don't:** Require specific LLM or IDE
**✓ Do:** Work with any LLM that can read files

**❌ Don't:** Add features because they're clever
**✓ Do:** Add features because they solve real problems

**❌ Don't:** Optimize for corporate use cases only
**✓ Do:** Serve solo developers and teams equally well

**❌ Don't:** Create rigid structure preventing customization
**✓ Do:** Provide templates but allow modification

## Future Evolution

**Principles That Won't Change:**
- Files over abstractions
- Zero dependencies
- Tool-agnostic approach
- Human and machine readable

**What Might Evolve:**
- Additional optional modules based on usage patterns
- Enhanced templates for specific project types
- Better tooling for visualization (optional)
- Integration with emerging AI capabilities

**How to Propose Changes:**
1. Use VIBECONTROL in real project
2. Document pain points or gaps
3. Propose solution maintaining core principles
4. Validate with community feedback
5. Implement if aligned with philosophy
